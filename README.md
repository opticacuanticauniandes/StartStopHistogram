Key Improvements:

Direct Histogram Summation: Now sums the actual experimental counts in the Gaussian region (defined as center ± 3σ, containing ~99.7% of a Gaussian)
Background Subtraction: Subtracts the background contribution from the same region:

SPDC coincidences = Total counts in Gaussian region - Background in that region


Visual Enhancement: The plot now highlights the Gaussian region used for SPDC calculation with a light green fill
Detailed Output: Shows:

The time range of the Gaussian region
Number of data points in that region
Total experimental counts in the region
Background contribution in the region
Net SPDC coincidences



Method:

Gaussian Region: Center ± 3σ (captures essentially all the signal)
SPDC Counts: Sum of experimental data points in this region minus background
Background: Fitted constant level × time interval in the region
Accidental: Background level × total time range

This approach is much more appropriate for histogram data and gives you the actual experimental coincidence counts rather than fitted curve integrals. The method properly accounts for the discrete nature of your measurement data.

New Features v2:

Temperature Extraction:

Uses regex to extract temperature from filenames like G2-52s-33C.txt → 33°C
Handles both uppercase and lowercase 'C'
Warns if temperature can't be extracted


Temperature Analysis Plots:

Combined plot: All three quantities (SPDC, accidental, total) vs temperature
Individual plots: Separate plots for SPDC, accidental coincidences
Signal-to-Background ratio: Shows how the ratio changes with temperature


Enhanced Summary Table:

Now includes temperature column
Results sorted by temperature for easier analysis


Temperature Statistics:

Shows temperature range
Identifies temperature with maximum SPDC
Identifies temperature with best signal-to-background ratio



Key Benefits:

Visual trends: Easy to see how coincidence rates change with temperature
Optimization: Identify optimal temperature for maximum SPDC or best S/B ratio
Quality assessment: See if accidental rates are stable across temperatures
Publication ready: Clean plots suitable for reports/papers

The code will automatically:

Process all your .txt files
Extract temperatures from filenames
Analyze each file for SPDC/accidental coincidences
Create comprehensive temperature-dependent plots
Provide statistical analysis of temperature effects

This is particularly useful for understanding thermal effects on your quantum correlation measurements!
