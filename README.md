Key Improvements:

Direct Histogram Summation: Now sums the actual experimental counts in the Gaussian region (defined as center ± 3σ, containing ~99.7% of a Gaussian)
Background Subtraction: Subtracts the background contribution from the same region:

SPDC coincidences = Total counts in Gaussian region - Background in that region


Visual Enhancement: The plot now highlights the Gaussian region used for SPDC calculation with a light green fill
Detailed Output: Shows:

The time range of the Gaussian region
Number of data points in that region
Total experimental counts in the region
Background contribution in the region
Net SPDC coincidences



Method:

Gaussian Region: Center ± 3σ (captures essentially all the signal)
SPDC Counts: Sum of experimental data points in this region minus background
Background: Fitted constant level × time interval in the region
Accidental: Background level × total time range

This approach is much more appropriate for histogram data and gives you the actual experimental coincidence counts rather than fitted curve integrals. The method properly accounts for the discrete nature of your measurement data.
